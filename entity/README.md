This was previously styled as a sub-directory of phileas but, sin ech can be used independently , has been made into a
package in its own right,=.
 
It contains components useful for creating invoices, quarterly accounts etc. for a small business within the Netherlands.

Warning: altough I have used this successfully myself for some years, I have done a log of "making it up as I go along".
Also, I have removed some company-sensitive information. I intend to include example dummy information in its place, but
haven't got around to it yet!.
