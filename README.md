Python Html Integration; Larry's Elegant Alternative Solution (=> acronym 'phileas')

I put the essentials of this python package together some years ago. I liked the idea of expressing
HTML in a natural python model without recourse to any sort of templating. I tried to take on board
nice features from some of the many other similar packages, while going my own way on other aspects.

Since that time, HTML5 has gained ground from HTML4 and perhaps the use of 'markdown' has gained much
 ground from both... but I'm carrying on (largely) regardless.
